Peer-graded Assignment   
Tony Gojanovic

## Background

This final project was done in partial fullfillment of course requirements for the Coursera Course "Building R Packages" as developed by John Hopkins University.  The author took this course in March/April of 2018.

The example used to illustrate development of an R package and uploading to Github was done using the National Highway Traffic Safety (NHTS) Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System data set.

## Create an Example Package in R 

Package: FARS
GitHub:  https://github.com/cowboy2718/fars_project

## Data Source

This package was motivated by reading and summarization of accident data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting 
System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars).
